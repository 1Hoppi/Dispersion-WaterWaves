# Dispersion-WaterWaves
My very first OpenGL application. It simulates waves on water surface

Compiling:
1) Open the lib folder and move "glfw3.dll" in any folder on your pc that is mentioned in your system PATH variable. (I'll do something with it later)
2) Open the workspace in your vscode and run "C/C++: g++.exe build active file" task (that's the only defined task in the tasks.json)
3) Executable file will be in the bin folder
